                      Having started his career as a journalist in South Africa the mid-1980s, Vuyo has had a front seat to our country’s history in the making. His first job, as a general reporter with anti-apartheid Struggle publication South Press in Cape Town, saw Vuyo covering the first major Umkhonto we Sizwe trials in the Western Cape, those of MK Lizo Ngqungwana, Tony Yengeni and Mxolisi Petane, as well as inquests into the high-profile deaths of MK soldiers Ashley Kriel, Coline Williams and Robbie Waterwitch, and the Gugulethu Seven. Later as political correspondent at the Weekend Argus, he was privileged to report on South Africa’s long-awaited transition to democracy.</p><p>
Taking a seven-year hiatus from newspapers, in 1995, he started his own communication venture, whose clients included a range of major private and public enterprises. Returning to newspapers, he rounded out his career in the Fourth Estate with stints as sports editor and news editor at Johannesburg-based newspapers. Later, he had the opportunity to apply his communication expertise for clients in both and private public sector.
Vuyo has acquired a Bachelor of Law, a Bachelor of Social Science, a post-graduate degree in Sociology, and a raft of tertiary diplomas in dispute resolution, media, and marketing. He has also been on the other side of the lectern, running a PR course at Damelin, conducting media training for clients and addressing international investment conferences in England and Germany in 1996.
In addition to being executive director of Skyeagle Communications Pty Ltd, he is a trustee of the Temba Bavuma Foundation and a director of Mza Diamond Resources Pty Ltd.

The news career of this journalism graduate from Cape Peninsula University began in 1987 at South Press, an alternative South African weekly newspaper.

Her TV journalism career began when she joined South Africa’s first independent free-to-air television station, e.tv in 1998. For eight years, she covered political affairs at Parliament and court trials. Ayesha has freelanced for various international and local television stations including France24, Sky (UK), NDTV (India), ARD (Germany) and FBC (Italy), SABC and ENCA. She covered a range of major social and political stories, from the State of Emergency in the 1980s to the unbanning of anti-apartheid organisations; the release in 1990 of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela; SA’s first democratic elections; and Mandela’s death in 2013.

                      Robyn Leary is a 30-year-plus veteran of the South African media industry.  Graduating with a BA Honours degree in Journalism and Linguistics from Rhodes University in 1988, she cut her teeth as a subeditor at Martin Creamer’s Engineering News before moving to the mainstream news media in the mid-1990s. 
She worked as a subeditor, helping to drive the production process, on a range of major national newspapers, including the Star and the Sunday Independent. Later, at the Cape Argus, first as chief subeditor, then as assistant editor, she had helped to pull together coverage on global news stories, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina, and, closer to home, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and Nelson Mandela’s death in 2013.</p><p> 
In 2016, Robyn opted to leave formal employment to start her freelance career as a copy editor. Her clients since then have been diverse, ranging from the Benin Association for Eco-development (ABED), to industry stalwarts Media24 and Highbury Media, to self-published authors and online bloggers. At Highbury, her work has focused on business titles, such as JSE Magazine, Business Day Earth, Business Day Empowerment, African Decisions, Mining Decisions, and the award-winning Earthworks. As an associate member of the Professional Editors Guild, Robyn is committed to ongoing professional development, mostly to feed her obsession with the Oxford comma.

                     Prof Mlungisi W Makalima 

If we had  to pick a word to describe for Prof Mlungisi Makalima’s career, it would be ‘transformative’:

Lecturing in the Sociology department at the University of Fort Hare in the politically turbulent 1980s, he introduced radical perspectives to the discourse;  he was a founder member and vice-president of the Association for Sociology in Southern Africa (ASSA); and later played a role in transformative initiatives at the university.
<BR>
Prof has had a front seat to history in the making. He participated in the formation of the progressive Union of Democratic Universities in response to the apartheid government’s clampdown, in 1987, on political activism on university campuses. Later, as chair of Fort Hare’s Macro-Economic Research Group (MERG) steering committee, he played a role in the formulation of Making Democracy Work, which stressed the importance of the concept of reconstruction and development in post-apartheid South Africa. 
<BR><br>
After leaving Fort Hare, where he had been appointed Associate Professor and substantive Head of the Department of Sociology, Prof made the transition to public service, holding senior leadership positions in the Eastern Cape provincial government, in the Department of Transport and Department of Social Development.

He  14 years in international diplomacy, starting with his appointment in 2001, as Ambassador to Argentina. Prof served as the South African High Commissioner to Zimbabwe between 2005 and 2011.  It was during this time – September 2008 – that South Africa successfully brokered the agreement that paved the way for a unity government in Zimbabwe. <br> 

Rounding out his diplomatic career, Prof served as Ambassador to the State of Palestine from 2011 until 2015.  His goal, among others, was to reproduce and sustain Nelson Mandela’s human rights legacy. <br>

In 2016 Prof joined the East London Industrial Development Zone, as board chair. Under his chairmanship, the entity has achieved four successive clean audits. Prof has, since 2018, served on the board of Beyond Zero, an NGO whose mission includes strengthening health-service delivery systems.<br>

He holds a Bachelor of Social Science Degree from Unisa; a BA Honours in Sociology from the University of Fort Hare; a Masters Degree in Sociology from the State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNNY-B); and a second Masters in Southern African Studies, from the University of York in England. 

Prof is a member of the Institute of Directors in Southern Africa.

                    <p>
                      Nkululeko Victor Masombuka’s twin passion for IT and language has been parlayed into a budding career in communications technology. That career began while he was still studying at the Vaal University of Technology; Nkululeko worked as a tech support analyst for African Flavour Books, which sells African literature and books in the SA vernacular languages. 
After graduating with a diploma in ICT from the Vaal University of Technology, Nkululeko was awarded a full scholarship by the United States Embassy in South Africa to take part in the US State Department’s Community College Initiative (CCI) in 2016/17 and further his IT studies. The CCI programme gives formerly disadvantaged youth the chance to study abroad for up to a year, enabling them to hone their technical skills, expand their leadership abilities and boost their proficiency in English. Nkululeko took full advantage of the opportunity, leaving Fox Hill Technical College (FHTC) in Wisconsin with a clutch of certificates: in web development; mobile app development; global studies and English business communication.</p><p>
Also, at FHTC, Nkululeko interned as a software developer helping to build an educational game for wisc-online, among other things. As with a lot of young techies, he did his time in tech support, working on the college’s help desk for six months.
In 2017, he was awarded a Civic Leadership Certificate through the US States Department’s Young Leadership Initiative. That same year he co-founded IT Prodigies, which sought to close the gap in access to IT services in underserved communities.
He has further polished his IT skills, interning as a support technician at the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, where his functions ranged from holding the hands, metaphorically speaking, of all end users to maintaining systems with complicated-sounding names such as BAS, LOGIS and PERSAL.
